# Getting Started
**Pantheon 0.8.0 RC2 release**
After you clone the PegaSysEng/pantheon repo, we recommend that you first run the 'pantheon' startup script for Linux/MacOS (or the 'pantheon.bat' startup script for Windows) in the pantheon-<ver>/bin directory. This script appropriately sets system variables and command-line arguments for Java, JVM, and Pantheon.
After you've run the startup script, we encourage you to read the Pantheon technical documentation, located on the wiki tab of PegaSysEng/pantheon:
    https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon/wiki
This wiki provides detailed information on getting started, along with tutorials and comprehensive reference content.
