# Getting Started with Pantheon

After you download and unpackage Pantheon:
1. At the command line, change into the `pantheon-<release>` directory. 

2. To display the command line help:
    ```json
    ./bin/pantheon --help
   ```

A [basic quickstart](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon/wiki/Quickstart) and other options for [starting Pantheon](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon/wiki/Starting-Pantheon) are included in the documentation. 

The documentation is included in this release package and on the [Pantheon Wiki](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon/wiki). 

>**Note** Starting Pantheon by double-clicking the `pantheon` or `pantheon.bat` executables starts a node synchronizing with the Ethereum mainnet.
