 * chosen over using the subscriber's object identity to eliminate a common trap believing that
 * method references are equal when they refer to the same method. For example, if object identity
 * were used to track subscribers it would be possible to write the incorrect code:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>subscribers.subscribe(this::onSomeEvent);
 * subscribers.unsubscribe(this::onSomeEvent);</code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Since the two separate <code>this:onSomeEvent</code> are not equal, the subscriber wouldn't be
 * removed. This bug is avoided by assigning each subscriber a unique ID and using that to
 * unsubscribe.
